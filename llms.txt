Fetch and analyze Hawaii school enrollment data from the Hawaii
Department of Education (HIDOE) in R or Python.

## Why hischooldata?

This package is part of the [State Schooldata
Project](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata), which started with
[njschooldata](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata) for New
Jersey. The goal is to provide a simple, consistent interface for
accessing state-published school data directly from state Departments of
Education - not federal aggregations that lose state-specific details.

Hawaii is unique: it’s America’s only statewide school district. One
state, one system, no local school boards. This package lets you explore
14 years of enrollment data (2011-2025, excluding 2012) across counties
and schools with a single function call.

## What can you find with hischooldata?

**14 years of enrollment data (2011-2025, 2012 unavailable).** ~167,000
students in 2025. Here are 15 stories hiding in the numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Setup: Load packages and fetch data

``` r
library(hischooldata)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)
```

``` r
# Get available years
years <- get_available_years()
if (is.list(years)) {
  max_year <- years$max_year
  min_year <- years$min_year
} else {
  max_year <- max(years)
  min_year <- min(years)
}

# Fetch data for the last 10 available years
year_range <- intersect((max_year - 9):max_year, years$years)
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(year_range, use_cache = TRUE)
enr_current <- fetch_enr(max_year, use_cache = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Hawaii is America’s only statewide school district

Unlike every other state, Hawaii operates as a single statewide school
district with approximately 290 schools. No local school boards, no
property tax funding. One state, one system.

``` r
statewide <- enr_current %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(n_students)
stopifnot(nrow(statewide) > 0)

# Count counties (Hawaii is organized by county, not individual schools in this data)
n_counties <- enr_current %>%
  filter(type == "COUNTY", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  nrow()

cat("Total students:", format(statewide$n_students, big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("Counties served:", n_counties, "(plus Charter Schools)\n")
#> Total students: 167,076
#> Counties served: 4 (plus Charter Schools)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Enrollment dropped ~15,000 students since 2016

Hawaii lost nearly 15,000 students since 2016. High housing costs push
families to the mainland, and birth rates are falling.

``` r
state_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", grade_level == "TOTAL")

stopifnot(nrow(state_trend) > 0)
print(state_trend)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 8

### 3. Enrollment by County

Hawaii’s single statewide district serves four counties plus charter
schools. Honolulu (Oahu) dominates enrollment, with about two-thirds of
all students.

``` r
county_enr <- enr_current %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", type %in% c("COUNTY", "CHARTER")) %>%
  mutate(county_label = reorder(county_name, -n_students))

stopifnot(nrow(county_enr) > 0)
print(county_enr)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 9
#>   end_year type    county_name     grade_level n_students subgroup         is_state is_county is_charter

ggplot(county_enr, aes(x = county_label, y = n_students)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#2C3E50") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Hawaii Enrollment by County",
       subtitle = "Honolulu dominates with two-thirds of students",
       x = "", y = "Students") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. COVID hit enrollment hard – 4,647 students lost in one year

When the pandemic struck, families moved to the mainland or shifted to
private schools. Hawaii lost 4,647 students (2.6%) between 2020 and
2021.

``` r
# Show year-over-year change during COVID
covid_change <- enr %>%
  filter(end_year %in% c(2020, 2021), grade_level == "TOTAL", type == "STATE") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
stopifnot(nrow(covid_change) == 2)

change <- diff(covid_change$n_students)
pct_change <- change / covid_change$n_students[1] * 100
cat("Enrollment change 2020-2021:", format(change, big.mark = ","),
    sprintf("(%.1f%%)", pct_change), "\n")
#> Enrollment change 2020-2021: -4,647 (-2.6%)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Kindergarten is shrinking faster than high school

Hawaii’s kindergarten enrollment dropped from ~13,900 to ~11,700 while
Grade 9 grew. The pipeline of students entering the system is narrowing.

``` r
k_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", grade_level %in% c("K", "09", "12")) %>%
  mutate(grade_label = case_when(
    grade_level == "K" ~ "Kindergarten",
    grade_level == "09" ~ "Grade 9",
    grade_level == "12" ~ "Grade 12"
  ))

stopifnot(nrow(k_trend) > 0)
print(k_trend)

ggplot(k_trend, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = grade_label)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("text", x = 2020.5, y = Inf, label = "COVID", vjust = 2, color = "red", size = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Kindergarten Shrinking Faster Than High School",
       subtitle = "The pipeline of students is narrowing",
       x = "School Year", y = "Students", color = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Private school competition is fierce

Hawaii has one of the highest private school enrollment rates in the
nation. Kamehameha Schools, Punahou, and Iolani draw thousands of
students who might otherwise attend public schools.

``` r
# Public enrollment as context
public_total <- enr_current %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  pull(n_students)
stopifnot(length(public_total) == 1)

cat("Public school enrollment:", format(public_total, big.mark = ","), "\n")
cat("Estimated private school students: ~35,000\n")
cat("Private school share: ~",
    round(35000 / (public_total + 35000) * 100, 1), "%\n", sep = "")
#> Public school enrollment: 167,076
#> Estimated private school students: ~35,000
#> Private school share: ~17.3%
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Charter schools grew 25% since 2016

Hawaii’s charter school enrollment grew from 10,444 to 13,094 students –
a 25% increase while overall enrollment declined.

``` r
charter_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(type == "CHARTER", grade_level == "TOTAL")

stopifnot(nrow(charter_trend) > 0)
print(charter_trend)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 9

ggplot(charter_trend, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, color = "#2C3E50") +

### 8. County trends over time

Each county shows its own enrollment trend. Honolulu (Oahu) dominates
overall enrollment but has seen the largest absolute decline.

``` r
county_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", type == "COUNTY")

stopifnot(nrow(county_trend) > 0)
print(county_trend)

ggplot(county_trend, aes(x = end_year, y = n_students, color = county_name)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", alpha = 0.5) +
  annotate("text", x = 2020.5, y = Inf, label = "COVID", vjust = 2, color = "red", size = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  labs(title = "Enrollment by County",
       subtitle = "Honolulu dominates but all counties affected by decline",
       x = "School Year", y = "Students", color = "") +

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. Special education enrollment

Hawaii tracks special education enrollment separately from regular
grades in the DBEDT data. SPED data is suppressed in the most recent
year per the Data Book footnote.

``` r
sped <- enr_current %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", grade_level == "SPED")

if (nrow(sped) > 0) {
  total <- enr_current %>%
    filter(type == "STATE", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
    pull(n_students)
  cat("Special education students:", format(sped$n_students, big.mark = ","), "\n")
  cat("Percent of total enrollment:", sprintf("%.1f%%", sped$n_students / total * 100), "\n")
} else {
  cat("Special education data not separately reported for this year.\n")
}
#> Special education data not separately reported for this year.
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Grade level distribution

Hawaii’s enrollment by grade shows the typical K-12 distribution, with
Grade 9 as the largest grade in 2025.

``` r
grade_dist <- enr_current %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", !grade_level %in% c("TOTAL", "SPED")) %>%
  mutate(grade_level = factor(grade_level, levels = c("PK", "K", sprintf("%02d", 1:12))))

stopifnot(nrow(grade_dist) > 0)

### 11. Honolulu lost 14,170 students while neighbor islands lost only 3,399

Honolulu County (Oahu) has about two-thirds of all students, but
neighbor island counties have maintained enrollment more effectively
during the statewide decline.

### 12. Elementary schools losing students faster than high schools

Elementary grades (K-5) have seen steeper enrollment declines than
secondary grades (6-12), reflecting declining birth rates over the past
decade.

``` r

### 13. Maui lost 2,346 students since 2016 – wildfires compound the decline

Maui County has seen enrollment drop from 21,080 to 18,734 since 2016.
The 2023 Lahaina wildfire added new challenges to an already declining
population.

``` r
maui_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", county_name == "Maui")

### 14. Pre-K enrollment holds steady around 1,600

Pre-Kindergarten enrollment has remained relatively stable around 1,600
students, fluctuating between 1,575 and 1,757 over the past decade.

``` r
prek_trend <- enr %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", grade_level == "PK")

### 15. Big Island holds largest neighbor island enrollment

Hawaii County (Big Island) has the largest student population outside
Oahu with 22,715 students, serving rural communities across a geographic
area larger than all other Hawaiian islands combined.

``` r
neighbor_comparison <- enr_current %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", type == "COUNTY", county_name != "Honolulu") %>%
  mutate(county_label = reorder(county_name, -n_students))

stopifnot(nrow(neighbor_comparison) > 0)

# Fetch one year
enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024, use_cache = TRUE)

# Fetch multiple years
enr_recent <- fetch_enr_multi(2020:2024, use_cache = TRUE)

# Statewide totals
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(type == "STATE", grade_level == "TOTAL")

# County breakdown
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(type == "COUNTY", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  select(county_name, n_students)
```

### Python

``` python
import pyhischooldata as hi

# Fetch one year
enr_2024 = hi.fetch_enr(2024, use_cache=True)

# Fetch multiple years
enr_recent = hi.fetch_enr_multi([2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024], use_cache=True)

# Statewide totals
enr_2024[
    (enr_2024['type'] == 'STATE') &
    (enr_2024['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL')
]

# County breakdown
(enr_2024[
    (enr_2024['type'] == 'COUNTY') &
    (enr_2024['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL')

.sort_values('n_students', ascending=False)
[['county_name', 'n_students']])
```

## Data Notes

### Data Source

Hawaii Department of Education via the [DBEDT State Data
Book](https://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/economic/databook/) (Tables 3.12
and 3.13).

### Available Years

- **2011-2025** (end_year convention: 2024 = 2023-24 school year)
- **Note:** 2012 data is unavailable (2011 Data Book was not published)

### Data Levels

- **State:** Statewide totals
- **County:** Honolulu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai
- **Charter:** Statewide charter school aggregate

### Suppression Rules

- Counts under 10 may be suppressed in some years
- SPED (Special Education) data suppressed in 2024-25 per Data Book
  footnote
- No demographic subgroups available (data is enrollment only)

### Census Day

Data represents October 15 enrollment counts (Official Enrollment Count
Day in Hawaii).

### Known Data Quality Issues

- Multi-year tables in some Data Books (e.g., 2021 has both 2020-21 and
  2021-22)
- COVID impact: 2020 Data Book duplicates 2019 data due to disruptions
- Charter school reporting changed over time
