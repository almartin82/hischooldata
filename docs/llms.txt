Fetch and analyze Hawaii school enrollment data from the Hawaii
Department of Education (HIDOE) in R or Python.

## What can you find with hischooldata?

**15 years of enrollment data (2010-2025).** 180,000 students today. One
statewide district. Here are fifteen stories hiding in the numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Hawaii is America’s only statewide school district

Unlike every other state, Hawaii operates as a single statewide school
district with approximately 290 schools. No local school boards, no
property tax funding. One state, one system.

``` r
library(hischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024)

enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Enrollment has been declining for a decade

Hawaii lost 15,000 students since 2015. High housing costs push families
to the mainland, and birth rates are falling.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2015:2024)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

See [Enrollment Trends
vignette](https://almartin82.github.io/hischooldata/articles/enrollment-trends.html#enrollment-has-been-declining-for-a-decade)
for visualization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. The most diverse state in America

Hawaii has no racial majority. Filipino, Native Hawaiian, White, and
Japanese students each comprise significant portions of enrollment. This
is true diversity.

``` r
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("asian", "hawaiian", "white", "hispanic", "multiracial")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students))
```

See [Enrollment Trends
vignette](https://almartin82.github.io/hischooldata/articles/enrollment-trends.html#the-most-diverse-state-in-america)
for visualization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. COVID hit Oahu hardest

When the pandemic struck, families on Oahu fled to the mainland or
shifted to private schools. Neighbor island schools were more resilient.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(end_year %in% c(2020, 2021), grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  group_by(complex_area, end_year) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = end_year, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(change_pct = (`2021` - `2020`) / `2020` * 100)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Kindergarten is shrinking faster than high school

Hawaii’s kindergarten enrollment dropped 20% since 2015. The pipeline of
students entering the system is narrowing.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "09", "12")) %>%
  select(end_year, grade_level, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = grade_level, values_from = n_students)
```

See [Enrollment Trends
vignette](https://almartin82.github.io/hischooldata/articles/enrollment-trends.html#kindergarten-is-shrinking-faster-than-high-school)
for visualization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Private school competition is fierce

Hawaii has one of the highest private school enrollment rates in the
nation. Kamehameha Schools, Punahou, and Iolani draw thousands of
students who might otherwise attend public schools.

``` r
# Public enrollment as context
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  pull(n_students)
# Compare to ~35,000 private school students statewide
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. The Complex Area system creates mini-districts

Hawaii organizes its 290 schools into 15 Complex Areas, each centered
around a high school. Some Complex Areas serve more students than entire
rural districts on the mainland.

``` r
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  group_by(complex_area) %>%
  summarize(students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. Neighbor islands are holding steady

While Oahu loses students, Maui, Big Island, and Kauai schools have
remained more stable. Rural Hawaii is not emptying out like rural
mainland states.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  mutate(island = case_when(
    grepl("Maui|Molokai|Lanai", complex_area) ~ "Maui County",
    grepl("Hawaii|Kona|Kohala|Hilo", complex_area) ~ "Big Island",
    grepl("Kauai", complex_area) ~ "Kauai",
    TRUE ~ "Oahu"
  )) %>%
  group_by(end_year, island) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE))
```

See [Enrollment Trends
vignette](https://almartin82.github.io/hischooldata/articles/enrollment-trends.html#neighbor-islands-are-holding-steady)
for visualization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. Special education serves 1 in 10 students

Hawaii provides special education services to over 18,000 students,
reflecting strong identification and service systems.

``` r
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "special_ed") %>%
  select(n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. English Learners reflect immigration patterns

Hawaii’s English Learner population includes students from the
Philippines, Micronesia, and Japan, reflecting the state’s unique
Pacific location.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "lep") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11. Honolulu dominates but neighbor islands hold stronger

Honolulu County (Oahu) has about two-thirds of all students, but
neighbor island counties have maintained enrollment more effectively
during the statewide decline.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  mutate(island_group = case_when(
    grepl("Honolulu|Oahu", complex_area) ~ "Oahu",
    TRUE ~ "Neighbor Islands"
  )) %>%
  group_by(end_year, island_group) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Islands](https://almartin82.github.io/hischooldata/articles/enrollment-trends_files/figure-html/honolulu-vs-neighbor-1.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 12. Elementary schools losing students faster than high schools

Elementary grades (K-5) have seen steeper enrollment declines than
secondary grades (6-12), reflecting declining birth rates over the past
decade.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         !grade_level %in% c("TOTAL", "PK")) %>%
  mutate(level = case_when(
    grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05") ~ "Elementary",
    grade_level %in% c("06", "07", "08") ~ "Middle",
    TRUE ~ "High School"
  )) %>%
  group_by(end_year, level) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### 13. Maui’s tourism economy shows in school enrollment

Maui County has seen enrollment fluctuations tied to its
tourism-dependent economy. The 2023 wildfires added new challenges to an
already changing population.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  filter(grepl("Maui|Molokai|Lanai", complex_area)) %>%
  group_by(end_year) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### 14. Pre-K enrollment signals future trends

Pre-Kindergarten enrollment provides an early signal of what elementary
schools will see in coming years. Hawaii’s Pre-K numbers show the
declining pipeline.

``` r
enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "PK", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
```

### 15. Big Island holds largest neighbor island enrollment

Hawaii County (Big Island) has the largest student population outside
Oahu, serving rural communities across a geographic area larger than all
other Hawaiian islands combined.

``` r
enr_2024 %>%
  filter(grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "total_enrollment") %>%
  mutate(island = case_when(
    grepl("Hawaii|Kona|Kohala|Hilo", complex_area) ~ "Big Island",
    grepl("Maui|Molokai|Lanai", complex_area) ~ "Maui County",
    grepl("Kauai", complex_area) ~ "Kauai",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )) %>%
  filter(island != "Other", !grepl("Honolulu|Oahu", complex_area)) %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```
