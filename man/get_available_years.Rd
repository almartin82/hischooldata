\title{Get available years for Hawaii enrollment data}
\usage{
get_available_years()
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{min_year}{Earliest available year (2011)}
\item{max_year}{Most recent available year (2025)}
\item{years}{Vector of all available years}
\item{description}{Human-readable description of the date range}
}
}
\description{
Returns the range of years for which enrollment data can be fetched
from the Hawaii Department of Education via DBEDT Data Book.
}
\details{
The \code{end_year} parameter follows the convention that it represents the
END year of the school year. For example:
\itemize{
\item end_year = 2024 means the 2023-24 school year (ending June 2024)
\item end_year = 2025 means the 2024-25 school year (ending June 2025)
}

Note on data sources: DBEDT Data Books are published annually and typically
contain enrollment data for the school year that ends in that publication year.
For example, the 2023 Data Book contains 2023-24 school year data (end_year=2024).

Known gaps:
\itemize{
\item end_year 2012 is not available (no 2011 Data Book published)
\item end_year 2020 appears in both 2019 and 2020 Data Books (COVID impact)
}
